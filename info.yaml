  top_module:  "tt_um_psychogenic_neptuneproportional"
  # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by prepending your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
# Before changing this, please reach out to us on discord to discuss your design.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.5

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a set of registers to divide the clock, and then some combinational logic
      to convert from binary to decimal for the display.

      Puts a slower square wave output on output 7.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the counter should increase by one every second.
